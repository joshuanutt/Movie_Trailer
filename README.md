  2. Add movies to entertainment_center.py where the code comments say to add them.  Use this format:      
      **movie_name = media.Movie("Movie Name", "Plot summary","Poster art","Trailer URL")**
  3. Add your movie_name to the movies list:  
      **movies = [movie_1, movie_2, movie_3, your_movie_name]**
