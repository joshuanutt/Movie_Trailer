# Movie_Trailer
Project 1 for Udacity back-end nanodegree

Prerequisites:
a) Python 2 must be installed.  Python 3 may work with some modifications but it will probably throw errors.

Installing and running the program:
1)  Download project files and save them all in the same location
** Note ** All .py files must be in the same folder for the project to run properly!
2) Simply click entertainment_center.py.  It will open your browser to a new tab and show you the movie trailers page.

To add movies:
1) Open entertainment_center.py in your favorite text editor.  I use Sublime, but notepad, notepad++, or the python IDLE should work fine.
2) Then, add movies in this format:
  movie_name = media.Movie("Movie Name", 
                           "Plot summary",
                           "Poster art",
                           "Trailer URL")
3) Finally, add your movie_name to the movies list:
  movies = [movie1,movie2,movie3,movie_name]
4) Save the file then run entertainment_center.py to see your changes! :)
